        <title>Continuous Integration for Phoenix Apps on CircleCI</title>
        
          <description>I just recently got turned on to Elixir and Phoenix. I decided to play around and write a small, stupid app that would function as a sort of bot for my company&#39;s Slack team. There are a handful of specs, and I wanted to be able use Continuous Integration to run those specs for me.</description>

          <description>So, it&#39;s been a really long time (&lt;em&gt;like a really, really long time&lt;/em&gt;) since I&#39;ve posted, or updated this site at all. Basically it&#39;s been because I haven&#39;t found the time to blog regularly anymore. The main reason, which is actually a good thing, is that I have been working full-time as the Lead Developer of</description>

        <title>Building That Don&#39;t Suck (a rails app) from scratch. Sneak Peak at the UI.</title>
        
          <description>So, now that I&#39;m done learning how to build Rails apps, it&#39;s time to use my knowledge to build some real applications. The first project I&#39;ve chosen to work on is called That Don&#39;t Suck. Basically, the idea for the website is a community of people that help each other find things that don&#39;t suck.</description>

        <title>Tealeaf Academy Review</title>
        
          <description>I recently finished the last lesson of the last week of the last course of Tealeaf Academy. I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience with anyone thinking about doing a Ruby on Rails bootcamp.</description>

        <title>How to seed file uploads from a remote URL for CarrierWave.</title>
        
          <description>I recently deployed an app to Heroku. It&#39;s a Netflix clone called MyFlix. The cover art for the different videos are image files stored in an S3 bucket. The files are uploaded when an admin creates a video through the app&#39;s interface. The wonderful CarrierWave gem, in combination with the Fog gem take care of uploading the image files to S3 and associating the appropriate URLs with the Video objects.</description>

        <title>Completely Done With Tealeaf Academy!</title>
        
          <description>Today I finished up the last of the assignments for Tealeaf Academy. We wrapped up our Netflix clone by giving the admin the ability to view payments and locking users out if their payment failed. I got to use a few new tools such as webhooks and ngrok.</description>

        <title>Done With Week 7 of Course 3 at Tealeaf Academy</title>
        
          <description>As I race towards the end of the last of Tealeaf&#39;s courses (only 1 week after this!), I find myself learning more in each lesson than a few of the previous ones combined. The amount of learning is growing at an exponential rate!</description>

          <description>It&#39;s crazy to think about it, but I only have 2 weeks left until I&#39;m done with all 3 courses at Tealeaf. I&#39;ve learned an absolutely crazy amount and I&#39;m so excited to get working on my own projects and look for a job in my new career.</description>

        <title>Done With Week 5 of Course 3 at Tealeaf Academy</title>
        
          <description>I just finished up week 5 of the 3rd course at Tealeaf Academy. This week didn&#39;t focus on as many new features as the previous weeks. We added the ability to invite a friend to join the site (We are working on a NetFlix clone). When the inviter invites a friend, the friend receives an email with a link that has a unique token. That token lets us look up the invitation and prefill the email address portion of the registration form. If the friend who was invited accepts and registers for the site using that url with their token in it, they are set up automatically to be following the person they accepted the invitation from and the person who invited them is also automatically following them.</description>

          <description>We covered a whole lot this week, I learned quite a few new things. A few things stood out however. Testing non-standard models with Shoulda matchers in RSpec.</description>

        <title>Finished Week 3 of Course 3 at Tealeaf Academy</title>
        
          <description>The first part of this week basically dealt with refactoring RSpec code by using macros and shared examples. These are really helpful because common things like checking to make sure an unauthenticated user is redirected to the sign in page if they try to do an action that requires them to be logged in can be extracted out to a single shared example. This means if for any reason down the road if you need to change the behavior of what happens when an unauthenticated user tries to perform a privileged action, you only need to change that shared example instead of having to go and change it in all of your test files.</description>

        <title>Finished Week 2 of Course 3 at Tealeaf Academy</title>
        
          <description>This week was really great for me. I think I am really starting to get the hang of the testing process and test driven design. In the first week and for most the of the first half of this week, I had to kind of hobble along, not writing much code before taking a look at the solution videos. I had an idea of what I needed to do, but I didn&#39;t really know exactly how to do it.</description>

          <description>So it took a little longer than a week, but I have finished up the first &quot;week&quot; of course 3 at Tealeaf. This course focuses on Test Driven Development (TDD) and the main project is building a NetFlix clone.</description>

        <title>Week 4 Completely Done, Ajax-ing It Up, Github Branches, Etc.</title>
        
          <description>So I&#39;m completely done with the fourth and final week of the first Tealeaf session - Introduction to Ruby and Web Development. I think I can honestly say that I have learned more this month than in all of the previous months trying to learn on my own. Tealeaf is the perfect balance of guided instruction and self-learning. I didn&#39;t have to quit my job and move across the country to do it and because I had time, I could work ahead and catch up with the suggested pace.</description>

          <description>So, I just wrapped up my Blackjack web app. You can play it here &lt;a href=&quot;http://zacjack.herokuapp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://zacjack.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m pretty proud of the little UI I came up with, including the scoreboard. I would definitely not consider myself a CSS expert, but I think I did a fairly good job.</description>

          <description>So I&#39;m playing catch up a bit at Tealeaf Academy. I originally signed up to do the pre-course work in January and then join the February session. I got the pre-course work done so I just decided to jump in with the January session (but be a few weeks behind).</description>
